# rock_paper_scissors
Developed an interactive browser-based game where users can play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer.  Used HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the game interface with responsive buttons and score display.  Implemented game logic with JavaScript to randomly generate computer choices, determine the winner, and update scores dynamically.
